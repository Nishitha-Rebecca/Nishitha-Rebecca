ðŸ‘‹A highly motivated and adaptable Verification and Validation Engineer, with a masterâ€™s in technology, bringing a strong background in digital design, hardware-software integration, and data-driven decision-making. Proficient in Verilog, System Verilog, UVM, and RTL Design, with hands-on experience in PCIe/CXL technology and RISC-V core implementation. Skilled in leveraging EDA tools and front-end design techniques for comprehensive system testing and optimization. Seeking to contribute to cutting-edge projects in a dynamic, growth-oriented environment, utilizing both technical expertise and analytical skills to drive innovation and organizational success.

As a dedicated Design Verification Engineer by day, I blend my technical expertise with a vibrant passion for life outside of work. I thrive on creativity and movement through dancing and working out, which keeps my energy high and my mind sharp.

In addition to my engineering career, I am a YouTube channel influencer, sharing glimpses of my day-to-day life and inspiring others along the way. Whether itâ€™s through sharing my fitness journey, dance routines, or personal insights, I love connecting with my audience and making a positive impact. Join me as I navigate the balance between technology and creativity!

but coming to my skills and projects, they are here as follows:

- Design Verification Engineer, Larsen & Toubro Technology Services (Jan 2022 - June 2023)

PCIe and CXL Technology for Intel Inc.: Led development and optimization, enhancing high-speed data communication, reducing Completion to Host (C2H) latency by 1 cycle, and streamlining FIFO architectures. Worked cross-functionally to troubleshoot and improve system performance and reliability.
RISC-V Core Implementation on Zed Board: Successfully implemented RISC-V core IP, booted PetaLinux, and established communication with Ethernet, DDR memory, and HDMI IP. Conducted comprehensive simulations for functional and performance validation.
Leadership and Collaboration: Guided multi-disciplinary teams, mentored junior engineers, and facilitated effective knowledge sharing. Participated in agile methodologies to ensure smooth project execution.
Engineer Trainee â€“ Internship, Regional Telecom Training Centre (BSNL) (Sept 2018 â€“ Oct 2018)

Gained hands-on experience with digital switching systems, mobile communication, optical fiber technology, and broadband. Contributed to network optimization discussions and observed telecom infrastructure applications.
Projects & Publications

Cardiac Arrhythmia Prediction and Classification: Developed a machine learning system using KNN, Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and SVM for early diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. Published research at NCRTE 2021.
Audio-Based Authentication System: Created a system integrating voice commands, secret coding patterns, and OTP verification. Utilized Arduino Uno and ATmega328P for pitch recognition. Presented at the National Conference on Recent Trends and Innovations in Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 2019.
